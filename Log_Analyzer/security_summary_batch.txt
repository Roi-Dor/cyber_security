AI FINDINGS:
PATTERN DETECTED: Directory Traversal Attempt
SEVERITY: Medium
AFFECTED LINES: Line 2
EXPLANATION: The log entry in Line 2 shows an attempt to access the /etc/passwd file using a directory traversal attack pattern ("/../../etc/passwd"). This is a common technique used by attackers to access sensitive files on a server.
MITIGATION: Review server security configurations to ensure directory traversal protections are in place. Consider implementing input validation and sanitization to prevent such attempts.

> 10:00:02 User 'admin' login failed (IP: 5.5.5.5)

AI FINDINGS:
PATTERN DETECTED: Brute Force
SEVERITY: Medium
AFFECTED LINES: 4, 5
EXPLANATION: The logs show repeated login failures for the user 'admin' from the same IP address (5.5.5.5) within a short time frame, indicating a potential brute force attack.
MITIGATION: Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts, monitor the IP for further suspicious activity, and consider blocking the IP if malicious behavior continues.

--- FINAL BATCH ANALYSIS ---
PATTERN DETECTED: Brute Force
SEVERITY: Medium
AFFECTED LINES: 1, 2, 3
EXPLANATION: The logs show multiple failed login attempts for the 'admin' user from the same IP address (5.5.5.5) followed by a successful login as 'root'. This pattern suggests a brute force attack where the attacker attempts multiple login attempts to gain access.
MITIGATION: Investigate the source IP (5.5.5.5) for malicious activity, consider blocking the IP, and review the 'root' account activity for any unauthorized actions. Additionally, implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
